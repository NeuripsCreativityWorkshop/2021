# NeurIPS ML4CD 2021 site WebApp

Webapp for the NeurIPS ML4CD 2021 site.
  
neuripscreativityworkshop.github.io/2021/

## Development

1. `yarn install` to install all package dependencies.
2. `yarn start` to start the devserver on http://localhost:8080.  
3. Make your changes. No need to refresh between changes; files changes/saves will automatically load on localhost. In other words, hot module replacement is on by default.
4. Once you are happy with your changes, build a static site for Github Pages with `yarn create:pub`. This will translate the react files to a static site for github pages, and save it in the `docs` folder.
